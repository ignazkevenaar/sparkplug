# Getting Started

## Supported Hardware

Sparkplug is designed to run on an ESP8266 module. It uses modular LED driver chips on connected to an I²C bus.

## Software Requirements

Sparkplug is an Arduino sketch with interchangable configurations for each of your models.

To build and upload the sketch you need either:

* [Arduino CLI](https://github.com/arduino/arduino-cli) ≥1.0
* [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software) ≥1.8.15

To upload any data to the [LittleFS](https://github.com/littlefs-project/littlefs) file system using the Arduino CLI please refer to [this section](#uploading-filesystem)

## Compiling

To install dependencies, compile and upload Sparkplug to your microcontroller, see [Compiling and Uploading](/guide/compiling-uploading)
