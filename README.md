# Sparkplug

Sparkplug is an Arduino boilerplate designed to run on an ESP8266 to add extendible and high-detailed lighting to scale model vehicles.

> Note: this software is currently under active development: anything can change at any time, API and UI must be considered unstable until we release version 1.0.0.

## Coilpack

Is the Vue-based web portal for controlling the lighting states, served from the ESP8266 web server.
