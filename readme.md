# Sparkplug

Sparkplug is an Arduino boilerplate to add extendible and high-detailed lighting to scale model vehicles.

> Note: this software is currently under active development: anything can change at any time, API and UI must be considered unstable until we release version 1.0.0.

## What is Sparkplug?

Sparkplug is an Arduino boilerplate designed to run on an ESP8266 to add extendible and high-detailed lighting to scale model vehicles.
While being designed to run on the ESP8266, because of the Arduino platform, it can be ported to run on different architectures.
The combination of cheap and well-known hardware and Wifi connectivity for controlling the lights using a web interface made the esp8266 a fitting solution.
